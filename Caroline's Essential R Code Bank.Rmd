# Welcome to Caroline's Essential R Code Notebook! These are in no particular order, just the code I find I use most and is most useful. Obviously, these are taken from different r projects and no data is provided, so you will have to play around with the variables and/or datasets that are comparable to what I have generated. But this should at least be a good place to start. In the event that a function does not work, google "what package is x function in"? And you may have to install and then library that package.

#INPUTTING PACKAGES and DATA
```{r common packages that you will probably want}
library("lme4")
#install.packages("lmerTest")
library("lmerTest")
#install.packages("emmeans")
library("emmeans")
#install.packages("pbkrtest")
library("pbkrtest")
#reshape melts our datasets in the way we want
library("reshape2")
library("dplyr")
library("plyr")
library("tidyverse")
library("Rmisc")
library("ggplot2")
library("performance")
library("see")
library("ggrepel")

#increase the number of results it will show
options(max.print=1000000) #this just prevents R from truncating the number of decimal places it will show you
```

```{r Establishing your working directory and uploading data}
#Establish working directory
require("knitr")
opts_knit$set(root.dir = "C:/Users/carol/Downloads") #I find that when doing R markdowns (which is what I use the most) using knitr to define my working directory works best
#NOTE if you are profficient in R and use R projects, you don't need knitr
getwd() #this will tell you what your current working directory is

#Upload your data
total_data <- read.csv("C:/Users/carol/Downloads/THESIS_DATA_INITALFINAL.csv", header = TRUE) #this is how you add data. Header=TRUE tells R that there is a header column with data labels.
```

```{r GIT}
#if you have a git file already on your computer and want to put everything into a repository, do the following in the TERMINAL:
# move to the project directory
cd Projects/website

# initiate the upstream tracking of the project on the GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/hansenjohnson/website.git

# pull all files from the GitHub repo (typically just readme, license, gitignore)
git pull origin master #often you can just skip this

# set up GitHub repo to track changes on local machine
git push -u origin master

#now everything should be connected and you can use the R studio git tab as normal
```

```{r Testing for normality and package to suggest transformation}
# In order to do a lot of statistical tests, you want your data to be normal. You can test this visually by looking at Q-Q plots and histograms. You should do this for each of your dependent variables.
#Histogram
hist(total_data$WEIGHT_M0) #You want this to look like a normal distribution bell curve
#Q-Q plot
qqnorm(total_data$WEIGHT_M0)#you want the points to follow the line pretty cleanly

#You can also test if your data is normal using a Shapiro test
shapiro.test(resp_all.data$resp_rate) 


#The below chunk of code takes a column of your data, checks to see if it is normal, and if it is not normal it suggests a certain transformation it thinks will make the data normal, you need the package bestNormalize
#install new package to see what the best transformation is
#install.packages("bestNormalize")
library("bestNormalize")
bestNormalize(resp_all_nitrate.data$resp_rate)
#in order for this to work I need to change the PAM_delta in to a vector
resp_all_nitrate.data$resp_rate_vector<-as.vector(resp_all_nitrate.data$resp_rate_vector)
#then I run the orderNorm command into a new object
orderNormobj_resp_rate<-orderNorm(resp_all_nitrate.data$resp_rate)
#this object gives us what we want, but we have to index from that object and put it in a new column
resp_all_nitrate.data$ordernorm_resp_rate<-orderNormobj_resp_rate$x.t

#Let say that you want to add another column with the transformed data
#adding a log transformed resp rate
resp_all_nitrate.data$log_resp_rate<-log(abs(resp_all_nitrate.data$resp_rate))
```

#BASIC DATA MANIPULATION

```{r Checking if there are outliers in the dataset}
#If you think there might be a statistical outlier in your dataset, you can do a grubbs test, which will tell you if there is an outlier and the value of that outlier
#This function is in the outliers package
#install.packages("outliers")
#library(outliers)
grubbs.test(resp_all_nitrate.data$resp_rate) 
```

```{r changing column names and removing them }
#changing some column names
pam_all.data<-subset(pam_all.data, select = -c(temp))
#renaming columns in base R because dplyr is freaking out
colnames(pam_all.data)[colnames(pam_all.data) == "sym_state"] ="sym_state_full"
colnames(pam_all.data)[colnames(pam_all.data) == "sym_state.1"] ="sym_state"
colnames(pam_all.data)[colnames(pam_all.data) == "temp.1"] ="temp"
```

```{r Subsetting OR selecting}
all_20C<-subset(resp_all_nitrate.data, resp_all_nitrate.data$temp==20)

#in subsetting the &, aka "and" is an additive function, and |, aka "or" takes anything that has either criteria

#selecting data by row (a condition within  a column)
env_chamber_HOBO_exp_2<- env_chamber_HOBO[env_chamber_HOBO$date  %in% c("8/4/2022", "8/5/2022", "8/6/2022", "8/7/2022"),] #the comma is important at the end here, tells R that we are looking at ROWs not entire columns

```

```{r TIDYVERSE -- mutate, filter, summarize}

# Change classid to be a factor
school_3_data <-
    school_3_data %>%
    mutate(classid = factor(classid)) #in base R you would use as.factor() but here you use mutate

#filter (similar to subset)
school_only_entry <- menhaden_all %>% filter(is.na(Number.of.Pounds)==TRUE , Number.of.Schools>=0)

```



# STATISTICAL TESTS AND MODELING

```{r T tests parametric and nonparametric}
#When your data follows a normal distribution
t.test(data$PAM , data$N_species_dose, paired=TRUE) #can have paired=TRUE or paired=FALSE depending on your data

#Use this Wilcoxon test when the data does not follow a normal distribution -- worth noting that Ethan Deyle really likes these tests!
wilcox.test(data$PAM , data$N_species_dose, paired=TRUE) #can have paired=TRUE or paired=FALSE depending on your data
```

```{r ANOVA and Tukey Posthocs}
#Do an ANOVA when you have multiple independent variables that you think explain your dependent variable
aov_resp_e_coli <- aov(resp_rate ~ temp + food, data=e_coli)
summary(aov_resp_e_coli) # you have to include this summary function here to actually look at the results of the ANOVA
#Now you will likely want to do a Tukey's pairwise posthoc
TukeyHSD(aov_resp_e_coli, "temp") #this tells you that you want to see pairwise comparisons of temperature

  #assumes linearity (normality)
  #interactions may be important

```{r Basic linear models -  lm() }
#When you have a complicated dataset and you want to see how various different independent variables effect your dependent variable and the magnitude of that effect, you usually want to create a linear model. This is essentially the same math as an ANOVA (from what Caroline understands, but she's no stats buff), but is really the gold standard for investigating the effects of your variables on your output.

#When generating a linear model, you first have to decide whether or not you want to include random effects. In a simple linear model using the function lm(), you are essentially doing an ANOVA. Often, though, we have random effects such as the tank or jar the organism was in, the colony the coral came from, or something else that we want to control for so that any variation caused by that random effect is put to the side and we can see what actually infludenced the data. When you have a random effect in your data, you want a linear model with random effects, which uses the lmer() function from the lme4 package.

#The lm() and lmer() functions work similarly, though in their syntax -- first you have your dependent variable, then a tilde (~), then your independent variables added to gether using a + sign, then a data= at the end. In the lmer() function, you include a random effect which for some weird reason needs to look like this,"(1|col_num)". Here is the same model, with and without a random effect:

simple_model <- lm(resp_rate ~ e_coli_plate + temperature, data=resp_all.data)

# NOTE: there is code that can give you a nice plot of linear model including residuals and standard error:
termplot(lm_mod, partial.resid=TRUE, se=TRUE)
```


```{r Linear models with random effects - LMER }

random_effects_model <- lmer(resp_rate ~ e_coli_plate + temperature + (1|tank_number), data=resp_all.data) #adding this random effect of tank number will allow me to investigate whether the data was influenced by the tank the corals were in
#using the (1|tank_number) syntax allows the intercept to vary between levels of tank_number
#There are several different ways to include a random effect in your linear model based on what you want:
(1 | group) # random intercept with fixed mean
(1 | g1/g2) # intercepts vary among g1 and g2 within g1
(1 | g1) + (1 | g2) # random intercepts for 2 variables
x + (x | g) # correlated random slope and intercept
x + (x || g) #uncorrelated random slope and intercept

# It is really important to know that in order to look at the results of your model, you need to use the summary() function around the object that you named the model.

#Here's how to interpret the output (YIIIIKES, this is tricky, but stick with me)

#What the heck does any of this mean?! Well really you want to focus on the Fixed effects table, specifically the Pr(>|t|) and the Estimate.

#The take-home that I get from this model is that either N_species_dose or food explain much about the model, because the p values for those are not significant (they are greater than 0.05).

#An estimate that is negative indicates that as that value increases, the response variable decreases. For example here, N species doses of 5 and 8 seem to increase respiration rate

#Honestly, when I am looking at these tables I am much more interested in pairwise comparisons between different independent variables (which we will get to in a section or two) then the effects on the whole model. But essentially this table tells you what independent variables are influencing changes in the dependent variable, and to what extent (estimate).

#The intercept is a really confusing concept that I still havent even fully understood, but what I do know is that 1) we don't really care about the intercept and 2) whatever independent variable you see missing is looped into that intercept. For example, in this dataset we had to different types of food regimes, fed (F) or starved (S). In the Fixed Effects table, I see foodS but not foodF. That is because foodF is the reference class, and so the model is comparing the effect of foodF (which we cannot see because it is magically inside the intercept) to foodS which we can see, and the p value for that comparison is 0.68 (not significant). Also, I dont see our control dosage of 0 for N_species_dose in the fixed effects table. That means it's wrapped up in the intercept.

#Effect size can be interesting to look into, but it's more helpful to look into when there are more straight forward pairwise interactions in our posthocs (more on that in a bit)

#A negative correlation number tells us if we were to do this experiment again, we would expect a negative relationship between our fixed effects and intercept

# NOTE: there is code that can give you a nice plot of linear model including residuals and standard error:
termplot(lm_mod, partial.resid=TRUE, se=TRUE)

# LMER models with random-effect slopes
# you may want to use a random-effect slope if you have reason to believe some factor will influence several things-- If we are looking at state birth data, we can estimate random-effect slopes for each state like this (similar to what we did above):
# Include the AverageAgeofMother as fixed-effect and State as a random-effect
model_a <- lmer(BirthRate ~ AverageAgeofMother + (1 | State), county_births_data)
tidy(model_a)
#random-effect slope may be estimated for each group using (slope | group) syntax with lmer()
#but lets say now we want to estimate a random-effect slope of each state, for example, perhaps the log of total population of each county, LogTotalPop, changes the birth rate of a county AND varies by state. AKA, we think that the log total pop will change WITHIN each state
model_b <- lmer(BirthRate ~ AverageAgeofMother + (LogTotalPop | State), county_births_data)
tidy(model_b)
# we could also look at the age as a random effect within EACH STATE
model_c <- lmer(BirthRate ~ AverageAgeofMother + (AverageAgeofMother | State), county_births_data)
summary(model_c)

```{r Linear model selection for normally distributed data}

By this, I mean interesting comes out as significant in the overall model, and not interesting is not significant in the overall model. There is actually a cool set of mathematical functions that can actually pull out what is interesting and take away what is not.

#The p value is pretty straight forward, it is a Tukey's pairwise comparison checking the difference between those two treatments
#The estimate is a bit more interesting and goes to our effect size. The effect that I am looking at is respiration rate, so the effect size is a change in respiration rate. How I would read this, looking specifically at the N_1.5 - N_18 row, is that corals that experienced the N_18 treatment respired 0.0007339 umols more than corals under the N_1.5 treatment. The pattern that I have found is that if the estimate is negative, then the first treatment had a higher value for respiration rate, an dif the estimate is positive, then the second treatment had a higher value for respiration rate.

# INTERPRET RESULTS FROM GAM
summary(mod_city3)
# Family: what distribution it is assuming
# Gaussian = normal
# Link: identity means it did not transform anything
# Parametric coefficients are the linear components
# Approximate significance of smooth terms covers the smooth terms
# edf= effective degrees of freedom, tells us the complexity of the smooth 
# IMPORTANT: an EDF of 1 is a straight line (linear)
# P values are approximate
# A significant p value is one where you cannot draw a horizontal line through the 95% confidence interval
coef(mod_city3) #can tell you the number of basis functions based on the number of coefficients


# VISUALIZING OUR GAM MODEL
plot(mod) #gives us the regular plot
#partial effects plots show the contribution of each smooth or linear effect of the model, which add up to the overall predictions
plot(mod, shade=TRUE, shade.col="hotpink") #shows us the confidence intervals in shade rather than dotted, and you can adjust the color using shade.col
plot(mod, residuals=TRUE) #adds the residuals in dots around the plot
plot(mod, residuals=TRUE, pch=1, cex=1) #changes the size of the residuals
plot(mod, select=3) #select only the price partial effect, which is term #3 in the model
plot(mod, pages=1, all.terms=TRUE) #plot all the effects in one page (YOU PROBABLY JUST WANT TO USE THIS)
plot(mod, select = 1, shift = coef(mod)[1], seWithMean = TRUE) #this shifts the vale of the intercept (which just allows it to be in terms of the scale we are interested in, it just adds a constant so that the numbers are interpretable) and includes uncertainty of the model with the seWithMean function, generally we want seWithMean=TRUE

#CHECKING THE MODEL FOR FITTING
gam.check(mod)
#first it checks for convergence, if the model has not converged its really not a good model, usually happens when there are too many parameters in the model for not enough data
#basis checking results shows a statistical test for patterns in residuals, which should be random
#each basis check shows the k value (number of basis functions) and p value. If p value is SIGNIFICANT, then residuals are NOT randomly distributed, which means that there are not enough basis functions
#we want the p values here to NOT be significant
#generates 4 plots:
  #we want q-q plot that is close to a straight line
  #we want histogram to be bell shape
  #residuals vs. linear predictions should be randomly distributed around 0
  #response vs. fitted values should clister around the 1:1 linear up line
#if one of the p values is significant, just play with the k= to figure out a better fit and keep using gam.check() until all of the p values under basis dimensions are not significant

#CHECKING CONCURVITY
#In linear models, colinearity is when two variables are so highly correlated that the model could fit to either one of them, and the model fit gets messed up
#Concurvity is when one variable looks like the smooth curve of another, WE DONT WANT THIS
concurvity(mod, full=TRUE) #full=TRUE reports concurvity for each smooth, aka how much each smooth is determined by all the other smooths
#if "worst" if over 0.8, inspect your model more carefully
concurvity(mod, full=FALSE) #full=FALSE returns matrices of pairwise concurvities (you usually want to do this AFTER you do full=TRUE), they pretty much just show how each variable is predetermined by each other variable so you can see which variables are the most closely related
#NOTE: the lower the concurvity, the lower the similarity to the other variables (we really want them to be different so the model can do what it needs to do)

# TWO DIMENSIONAL / MULTIDIMENTIONAL SMOOTHS
mod2d <-gam(y ~ s(x, y), data=dat, method="REML") #models the interaction of the two variables, you can always add different linear or nonlinear components withing s() functions or  + linear term

#this takes more effective degrees of freedom and therefore more data
#use this when you have x and y coordinates, generally a natural way to model spatial data

vis.gam(model4c, theta=125, plot.type="persp")

#TENSOR DATA -- used for data on two different units of meaure (aka space or time)
#a tensor is simlar to a smoothing parameter, but it is different in that it has two smoothing parameters, one for each variable
#when you dont want the model to think that two variables are going to vary similarly (like space and time) you want to use a tensor
#each variable gets its own smoothing when you are putting them in an interaction term
gam(y ~ te(x1, x2, k=c(10,20)), data=data, method="REML") #te indicates a tensor, and you can specity a different k for each tensor
#tensor interactions-- you want to use these when you wan to separate out the univariate effect of a variable AND its interaction term 
gam(y ~ s(x1) + s(x2) + ti(x1,x2), data=data, method="REML") #ti allows you to ONLY look at the interaction, and not their independent effects (the smoothing functions take care of their independent effects)

#the estimate tells us the probailiyt of a person making a home purchase who has mean values of all variables
# Fit a logistic model
plot(binom_mod) #this is on the log odds scale, so we want to change the scale
plot(binom_mod, pages= 1, trans= plogis) #changes everything to probability
plot(binom_mod, pages= 1, trans= plogis, shift=coef(binom_mod)[1]) #incorporates the model intercept, adds same value to everything
plot(binom_mod, pages= 1, trans= plogis, shift=coef(binom_mod)[1], seWithMean=TRUE) #generally you want to include the SE too, and you can use shade.con to change color etc
#you can tell what has the biggest effect on the outcome variable based on which partial effect spans the largest range on the y axis, so it has the highest probability

#MAKING PREDICTIONS IN GAM
predict(log_mod2, type="link") #generally gams are fit to the link scale which is a normal distribution im pretty sure I have NO idea why they dont just say normal
#for the probability scale, you want type="response"

#GAMs can also "explode" at the end, meaning that the confidence interval is really big
#WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FOR IN THE DIAGNOSTIC PLOTS
# We want the response v fitted to be a 1:1 straight linear line with the dots surrounding it
# We want the histogram of residuals to look like a normal distribution
# We want residuals vs. linear to look random – like a blood splatter lol
# For the Q-Q you want it to follow the line. Anything BELOW 0 is underestimating the error, anything ABOVE 0 is overestimating the error
